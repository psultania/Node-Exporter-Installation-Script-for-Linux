# Node Exporter Installation Script
Linux Node Exporter Installation Script will install node_exporter on the linux server automatically whichever version you want. This script will also create the service (systemd) script as well. This script will help you running node exporter running on the custom IP Address and PORT. 

What's in this script:
1. User interactive script
2. User Required version will be installed
3. Custom System script will be created automatically.
4. Only 2 step interactive script.



Note: This script is not public, it is private script. Intentionally I didn't released this script as public, talk to me or [send me the message](mailto:prashantind2020@gmail.com?subject=Prometheus%20Script%20for%20Linux) if you need the script.
